## Training and Inference Scripts

This folder contains scripts for training and running inference on the models for various tasks.

### Important Notes

- Before running the scripts, make sure to:
  - Download the appropriate **training** or **testing datasets**.
  - Configure the model settings as described in the **recipes** folder.

- The `SEMambaCoDe2dReAt` script corresponds to the **ASE-TM** model.

- Many of the script files are nearly identical and may contain redundant code. This can be refined in future versions.
